How to prepare illustrations for documentation
----------------------------------------------

Proper illustrations are crucial for good documentation, but it's highly
desirable to have a common look for them. Current style is the following:

 #. Render your scene as point cloud
 #. Import points into Paraview
 #. Apply Glyph transform
    - Glyph mode: all points
    - Representation: Surface with Edges
    - background color: white
    - solid color: RGB 205, 230, 255
    - edge color:  blue 128
    - center axes visibility: on
    - orientation axes visibility: off
    - screenshot: 600x600 or something x600
